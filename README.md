## To use plop

After installing the project dependencies with: **yarn** or **npm install** you must use the **yarn plop** command.

At this point, the **plopfile.js** file will be read.

This repository is just an example of using PlopJS, I strongly recommend that you look at the [official documentation](https://plopjs.com/documentation/)
